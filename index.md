## Welcome to My website!

Here is where I update status and post needed updates of all of my projects I am currently working on.  

### Electric Mountian Board
  I designed and created an electric mountian board which I use to get around DC.  **pictures coming soon**
Specs: 
- Dual 2400 watt brushless motors
- 150amp brushless ESCs
- Dual 6 cell 5.2 amphour lipo battery packs

To Do:
- Add flat spot to motor shaft to prevent set screw from slipping
- create better box for housing electronics 

### 5.5 Watt Diode Laser Cutter/Engraver
  I modified a BangGood 5.5 Laser engraver kit to cut balsa and black acrylic.  ** pictures coming soon**

To Do:
- add a compressor or blower to tool head to prevent smoke from unfocusing laser beam
- add z axis for auto focusing 
- add linear rods to x and y axis to improve stability at speed

### GW Rocket Team
  Designed and programmed the GW Rocket Team's Telemetry system with programming assitance from github user omn0mn0m.  
  
  Currently, the Rocket Team uses a 900mhz Xbee XSC S3B 
  
  To do:
  - repair electronics from launch
  - make electronics capable of 30 G acceleration for competetion launch
  - add real time data plotting for velocity, GPS, altitude, acceleration
  - add real time data logging on both the ground station and in the nose cone
